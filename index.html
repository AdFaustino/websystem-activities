                <h2>About the Author</h2>
                <p><span class="author-name">Adrian Faustino</span> is a 21-year-old third-year student at STI College Sta. Mesa, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. Lately, he spends most of his time coding, occasionally succeeding and often wondering why things that should work simply don't.</p>
                <p>This activity was created as part of the Web Systems and Technologies course. Outside of coding, he enjoys watching Korean dramas, anime, and recently got into webtoons. He also picked up the Rubik's cube, with a personal best of 54 seconds, and is currently learning chess, often finding himself outplayed by bots. </p>
                <p>He used to play a lot of League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics but has mostly stepped away from gaming to focus on studying. The problem? He stays up way too late and runs on little to no sleep. At this point, his ability to function might be more impressive than his coding skills. If there's one thing that needs debugging, it's definitely his sleep schedule.</p>

                <h2>What is Web Systems?</h2>
                <P>A web system is a combination of tools and technologies that work together to deliver websites and online applications. It includes the structure, design, functionality, and backend that allow users to interact with and access content on the internet. Web systems can be simple websites or complex applications like social media, online shopping, or cloud services.</P>

                <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
                <p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard language used to create the basic structure of web pages. It defines elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images, organizing how the content is displayed in a browser. HTML is essential for building any web page, forming the skeleton to which CSS and JavaScript are added to make the page functional and visually appealing.</p>
